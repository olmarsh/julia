# Julia Generator

This is the repository for the Julia Generator made by olmarsh and modernised by Destructor_Ben. We're too lazy to build it ourselves for you so you will have to build it if you want to use it.

## How To Run
A config file must be placed in the same folder as the executable named 'config.yml'. There is an example config in the root of the repository. The name of the generated file will always be 'Julia_{TimeStamp}.png' to avoid name conflicts.
